K Closest Points to Origin
Difficulty: MediumAccuracy: 67.3%Submissions: 9K+Points: 4
Given an array of points where each point is represented as points[i] = [xi, yi] on the X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance, defined as: 

sqrt( (x2 - x1)2 + (y2 - y1)2 )

Note: You can return the k closest points in any order, driver code will sort them before printing.
SOLUTION:
K Closest Points to Origin
class Solution{
public int[][] kClosest(int[][] points, int k) {
        // Your code here
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq= new PriorityQueue<>((a,b)->
            (b[0]*b[0]+b[1]*b[1])-(a[0]*a[0]+a[1]*a[1]));
        for(int i=0;i<points.length;i++){
            pq.add(points[i]);
            if(pq.size()>k){
                pq.poll();
            }
        }
        int[][] ans= new int[k][2];
        for(int j=0;j<k;j++){
            ans[j]=pq.poll();
        }
        return ans;
    }
